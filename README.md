Assembly Language Programming code for CPU-OS Simulator
Problem Statement

A data analyst Mr. Ashok is working on information collected by a mobile service provider ByTel regarding monthly usage of data. The information
collected is in the form of a Matrix (X axis - Total data downloaded in GB vs Y axis - Month of the year). He plans to use the Kibana (data
visualization) tool to plot the data in charts. The tool prefers Months as X axis and data downloaded as Y axis. Hence he requires you to incorporate
the following using CPU OS simulator based assembly language program:

1. Accept the data collected in the form of a Matrix (X axis - Total data downloaded in GB vs Y axis - Month of the year) from the keyboard.
2. Transpose the matrix.
3. Display the transposed matrix on console.
